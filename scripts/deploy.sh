# CyberShield AI Platform - Production Deployment Script
# ==============================================================================
# This script automates the complete deployment of the CyberShield AI Platform
# in a production environment using Docker containers.
#
# Features:
# - Automated dependency verification and environment setup
# - Secure environment variable configuration with template generation
# - Health checks for all critical services
# - Enterprise security validation
# - Comprehensive error handling and status reporting
#
# Usage:
#   chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh
#   ./scripts/deploy.sh
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Docker and Docker Compose installed
# - Proper environment variables configured
# - SSL certificates for production HTTPS (optional)
# ==============================================================================

# Enable strict error handling
# -e: Exit immediately if any command fails
# This ensures the script stops on any error for safety
set -e
